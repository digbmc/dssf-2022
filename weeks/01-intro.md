### 9:00 AM Group Check-In (DMCL)

### 9:15 AM Setting SMART Goals
- Specific: What will be accomplished? What specific actions will you take?
  - Think of this as a mission statement. You should be able to precisely state what the outcome of your work or effort will be.
- Measurable: What "data" will you use to measure your goal or to determine if it has been met? 
  - If this is a long term goal, what milestones (or sub-goals) will you need to meet on the way to achieving it?
  - Measurement methods can be both quantitative and qualitative.  Use the measurement form that *best* suites your specific goal.
- Achievable: Can you reasonably accomplish the goal?  Do you have the necessary skills or resources?
  - If you don't currently have the skills need to achieve the goal, how will you acquire them?  These can be some of your measurable milestones.
- Relevant: Does this particular goal align with broader project or personal goals?  How is the outcome important?
- Time-bound: What is the time frame for accomplishing this goal?  Is it realistic?
